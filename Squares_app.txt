SQUARES OSX APP
https://github.com/benslaney/Squares

Useful GUI for building up datasets for TensorBox (https://github.com/Russell91/TensorBox)

NOTES: 
- Currenlty it only works with the old .idl file format, but should be very easy to update to JSON.
- It's not perfect, and it seems to have some issues in os x 10.12 sierra

It's AS IS software, we are just putting it out there so it doesnt go to waste.

Cheers,
